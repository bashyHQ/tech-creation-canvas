# when did you change this?
date: July 29th, 2014 – 11:50


problems:
# Please describe the problems this is solving
  - a lot of great content is hidden in unaccessible forums
  - forums have aged and aren't up to date anymore – technology wise
  - though forums have always been a great way of discussing for humans, their lack of usability and accessibiltiy threatens a free and open discourse
  - more and more highly relevant discourse moves on to social platforms, making them in-accessible, harder to find and ultimately out of the control of the organisers behind it
  - good moderation on existing forums and social networks is hard, making it unneccassirily harder to nurture for a great community


solutions:
# what is the proposed solution?
  - "an open-source re-implementation of forums if they were built today: using latest technologies and build-in tools that make moderation and control much easier"

alternatives:

  - nodebb
  - facebook
